                <p>I typically listen to podcasts while I mow my yard. I find mowing relaxing and<br>enjoy doing it myself. However, some of the recent episodes of the podcasts that<br>I like did not catch my interest, so I went digging through some archives. I<br>stumbled upon <a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">DotNetRocks</a> episode <a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=1118" target="_blank" rel="external">1118</a> with <a href="http://dannorth.net/" target="_blank" rel="external">Dan North</a>. All I can say is wow,<br>what an episode. I started out my career with the view point that I just needed<br>to deliver software that made peoples life better. I didn’t care about the<br>craftsmanship, as long as it worked and people found it useful, I was happy.<br>Somewhere along the way I lost that, over my short eight year career I became<br>to focused on writing “great” software, that I lost my primary focus, which<br>was writing software that delivered business value. So here is the email<br>that I sent my team today, you will notice lots of qoutes and paraphrasing<br>from that episode. I just wanted to share and hope others get back to what<br>really matters, putting solutions in the hands of people to improve their<br>lives.</p>
<h2 id="The-Email"><a href="#The-Email" class="headerlink" title="The Email"></a>The Email</h2><blockquote><p>The goal of software delivery is to minimize the lead time to business<br>impact. Everything else is detail.<br>—Dan North</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is super important concept to understand. We are here to add value to the<br>business so delivering impactful improvements and solutions is what is the most<br>important. The <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Agile Manifesto</a> is not about doing SCRUM, Extreme Programming,<br>etc. These are all commoditized versions of the ideas behind the manifesto that<br>have occurred over the 14 years following it. I think our team is a great<br>example of all of these values. We do lots of these already and I think we have<br>good values as a team. We are integrated into the business and now that all of<br>us are sitting with the business, the opportunities to add more value should<br>be more evident.</p>
<blockquote><p>Velocity = Speed in a direction<br>—Dan North</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Story points are not points going toward a particular goal. We have lost<br>sight of solving business problems, agile is now about producing software<br>faster. We have strayed from the whole point.<br>—Dan North</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Nothing we deliver is worth anything unless it delivers the businesses<br>objective.<br>—Dan North</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Agile metrics are total BS, they are worthless as far as the business is<br>concerned, because it doesn’t answer the questions that the business cares<br>about. We should use business metrics to determine how effective we are.<br>A fine example of that is the call center metrics that were displayed at the<br>community meeting. Those are the types of metrics we should be measure using.<br>Points, sprints, etc. doesn’t show the business value that we are actually<br>delivering.</p>
<blockquote><p>Until customers are actually using it,<br>then we are making stuff up.<br>—Richard Campbell</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Two conflicting values, simultaneously. I will write the best software I<br>can. I will have not emotional attachment to the software that I write.<br>Transfer emotional attachment of the code to the product, the impact on<br>users. Cared less about the beauty of the code and more on the impact on<br>success and happiness of the users. Software is the means to the end.<br>As little software as needed to get there.<br>—Dan North</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Successful software teams blur the lines between the business<br>and development.<br>—Dan North</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I think we should keep doing the bi-weekly planning/retrospective meeting<br>that sets goals, but I think we should do away with points and I don’t think we<br>really need a scrum master, but an organizer. We are all “scrum masters” and we<br>should keep each other moving forward and impacting the business. We need to<br>keep having our “SCRUMS” since that is super valuable interaction, maybe we<br>should call them huddles or something else as not to confuse our approach with<br>a well-known process.</p>
<p>I also think we should determine all the business metrics that are reflective<br>of the work we are doing and we should monitor these to determine the type of<br>impact we are having. Some of these may take a complete year before coming to<br>fruition, but we should be playing the long game to begin with, the short game<br>will be evident in the attitudes that our customers have about us.</p>
<blockquote><p>GANTT Chart = Product Backlog<br>—Dan North</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(<em>Borrowed from Dan North</em>) So think about it like surgery.  We don’t want more<br>stitches more procedures, we want the surgeon to use the least invasive<br>procedure to treat the medical issue. That is how we should look at what we do.<br>What is the simplest solution we can provide that is technically sound and eases<br>the businesses issue.</p>
<p>So I know this is very long, but I think that we actually have our process.<br>I have spent a lot of time focusing on process improvement, when I should have<br>been focusing on distilling the process that was emerging out of how we are<br>actually delivering value to the business. Lets keep shipping features that add<br>value to the business and individual users. I want to create a product that<br>people love to use and makes their day better. We have been working hard to get<br>there and it is evident in the call center metrics, so lets keep doing this<br>until we stop being successful or until we determine that it is no longer<br>adding value, then we will evolve.</p>
