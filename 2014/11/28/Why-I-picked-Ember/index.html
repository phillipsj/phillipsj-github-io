                <p>This is going to be long post, probably a ramble, about why I settled on Ember as the new age<br>MV* framework I wanted to learn.</p>
<p>When I first go started doing development, the ecosystem that I was working in was ASP .NET Web Forms. I<br>learned to do all client-side interaction on the server and I always found myself struggling. Then<br>along came the AJAX toolkit for ASP .NET, which enabled me to do cool things like auto update content<br>areas without having to write any JavaScript or understand what was happening. Then as richer client<br>experiences started gaining traction, my current team and I decided to go wtih Silverlight as most of<br>us didn’t have large amounts of experience with JavaScript or Flex. Eventually, we ran into the issue<br>that Flex and Silverlight are on the way out, so we decided to go JavaScript and started embracing jQuery<br>and Dojo. jQuery because of its popularity and ease of use, Dojo becausee the GIS technology that we were<br>using was built on top of Dojo. I left that job not to long after the transtion and found myself working on<br>a project using ExtJS. As somewhat frustrating as it was, I really liked the framework and its implementation<br>of a MVC style architecture. I was able to quickly convert a Flex application into a pure JavaScript application<br>using ExtJS in a matter of weeks. In this same job, I also inherited support of a Dojo and Knockout application so<br>I was exposed to the Knockout paradigm.</p>
<p>As an aside, during this time I was also migrating from ASP .NET Web Forms to ASP .NET MVC, experimenting with Django, Ruby on Rails,<br>and various PHP MV* server side frameworks. This ushered me into a new future, that I could understand and grasp more easily<br>than ASP .NET Web Forms.</p>
<p>What I discovered along the way is that I really like opionated frameworks and convention over configuration. Why waste my time doing<br>repetitive tasks and making descisions that I was indifferent about, when I can be solving peoples problems. Lastly, since the single page<br>application was being more prevelant and the building of web APIs to provide an agnostic way for all your clients to access the same<br>server-side logic, I knew that I need to get cozy with a good JavaScript framework that was lighter weight than Dojo or ExtJS and had a<br>style (opinion) that set comfortable with me.</p>
<p>I knew I could rule out Knockout, I really liked it, but it wasn’t a complete package. Backbone doesn’t provide enough structure.<br>Angular was sweeping the dev communities that I was plugged in to, so I decided I would check it out. As I learned more about Angular,<br>I found that there was not a lot of guidance to application structure, there was not a built-in router, and the use of data attributes<br>just bothered me. Why do frameworks insist on messing with your HTML. I want clean HTML and I felt Angular didn’t give me that. Another<br>struggle with Angular is the weird naming of things (Ember does it too), why name stuff after patterns, when the pattern doesn’t really<br>fit. I questioned the descision to not go with Angular, but the recent news of 2.0 reassures me that I am glad that I didn’t. I breifly considered Durandal, but it was announced that Rob was going to Angular. I would consider it now that Rob is back.</p>
<p>So after all this searching I decided to finally pick up Ember. Rob Conery’s posts about Ember scared me off initially, and finally Rob put out a post that ran through the terminology used by Ember into terms that I could understand which helped. I then started working through a couple tutorials to see how I liked their philosophy. I will say the first few weeks were really trying my patience, but once it started to click, I realized that my style really fits well with Ember.  So that is kind of why I am embracing Ember. Clearly, with my<br>recent flurry of posts, it would be obvious that Ember and I mesh well.</p>
<p>Thank for reading</p>
